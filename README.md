# ðŸš¢ Battleships

This is a simple implementation of the popular game Battleship. </br>
The rules are simple, you should try to make all of the computer ships sink, by guessing their coordinates. </br>
There are 3 Ships: </br>
 - 1 x Battleship (Located on 5 squares) </br>
 - 2 x Destroyers (Located on 4 squares) </br>
 If you decide to give up, you acn type "show" in the console and you will see where are the ships located on the gameboard. </br>
 After making all ships sink, the game is over and you will see how many moves did it take for you to win. </br>
